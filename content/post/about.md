DevOps, SRE, and cloud engineering, these topics require no introduction. They seem to be the buzz words found in every job portal and in social sites such as LinkedIn. However, with such a huge demand for job roles such as “DevOps Engineer", "DevOps Architect", "DevSecOps Architect" etc., it pays to know a little bit more about them. Have you ever wondered the difference between a "Linux Administrator" and a "DevOps Engineer, or what does it mean to be a DevOps Engineer? I sure had when I began my journey.

I had my questions right from the beginning and I embarked on a journey to learn about DevOps, SRE, Cloud and Software Engineering. Being a Biotechnologist/Bioinformatician it was a steep S curve that I travelled to be where I am today. They say that if you spread your knowledge, it grows. Keeping that in mind, I would love to help a fellow traveller on the way to become a little more “At-Home” with these topics.

Today, on my 36th birthday, I launch this blog post with a commitment to seek and share knowledge. I welcome you all to my blog. I wish you success with my heart.
